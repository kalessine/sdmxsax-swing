Sdmx Sax Swing Demo

This is a demonstration program that can open sdmx files (version 2.0, or version 2.1)
or use publicly available sdmx data services (ABS, OECD, IMF, ESTAT)

The data messages returned are displayed in a table format (flattened format)..

To use a data service, select a data service from the drop down list..
the 'Dataflows' listbox will be populated with available cubes..

select a cube, and press 'load' to load the query interface for the cube...

Enter a start time and an end time, for each dimension, specify whether you want a single
value, multiple values (and select some values), or all values for that dimension..
then click 'query' (in the bottom right hand corner.. sometimes you need to resize the query interface to get this to appear)..
and the results will be displayed in a table format...

you can change the language displayed by going to 'edit' 'Locale' and choosing a different locale.
